== Frequently Asked Questions ==

[__Also check out our vertical mega menu faq page__](http://www.designchemical.com/blog/index.php/frequently-asked-questions/jquery-vertical-mega-menu/)

= The menu appears on the page but does not work. Why? =

One main reason for this is that the plugin adds the required jQuery code to your template footer. Make sure that your template files contain the wp_footer() function.

Another likely cause is due to other non-functioning plugins, which may have errors and cause the plugin javascript to not load. Remove any unwanted plugins and try again. Checking with Firebug will show where these error are occuring.

= How should I structure my custom menu to get the best results? =

The widget works by taking the standard menu structure and creating the sub-menus from the nested links. To get the full effect you need to have 3 levels within the custom menu:

1. First level is used for the main menu items
2. The second level is used to create the sub-menu headings
3. The 3rd level links are then grouped together under the headings to create the menu options

Example: Products --> Category --> Product Ranges

= The menu appears on the page and looks correct but I cant see the flyout menu? =

Make sure that your theme does not have the side column, where your menu is located, set to overflow: hidden in the style sheet file - this will hide the flyout menu
