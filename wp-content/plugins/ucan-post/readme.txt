The easiest way to allow your users, and even guests, to create posts on your blog. Users don't need to access the Dashboard to do so either as this plugin adds a page to the front end of your site for quick posting.

== Description ==
The easiest way to allow your users, and even guests, to create posts/content on your WordPress-based site. uCan post adds a configurable submission form to a page on your site allowing users to contribute content to your site. The best part about this is that your users/guests don't have to access the dashboard. With just a handful of simple yet powerful settings you can have this all setup in under 3 minutes. uCan Post imitates the regular WordPress post/page editor and even allows Media Uploads.
